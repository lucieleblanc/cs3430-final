	<h1>Audiovisual Tonnetz Lattice Modulation</h1>
	<h3>Michael Jan (mj2886), Lucie le Blanc (ll3163)</h3>

	<p>For our final project, we implemented a 
	Tonnetz lattice in JavaScript with WebAudio and P5.js.</p>

	<h5>What is a Tonnetz lattice?</h5>
	<p>
	The Tonnetz lattice is a visual representation of major and minor triads. 
	It represents triads as triangles, where each point is a distinct note. 
	Adjacent triangles represent triads with common notes. 
	If two triangles share a point, the triads they represent share one note. 
	If they share an edge, the triads they represent share two notes.
	In theory, the closer two chords are on the Tonnetz lattice, 
	the closer together they are harmonically, 
	meaning it is easier for the ear to transition from one to the other.
	</p>

	<p>
	We think the Tonnetz lattice is a fairly intuitive representation 
	of one of the most basic concepts of Western music theory, 
	and wanted to use WebAudio and some kind of visual to make the 
	Tonnetz lattice more tangible than a Wikipedia article.
	</p>

	<h5>Connecting chords using the lattice</h5>
	<p>
	In our project, we use the Tonnetz lattice to find modulation paths 
	between two user-inputted chords. We implemented this using a classic
	breadth-first search algorithm, using chords as nodes in a graph.
	To find neighboring chords, we replaced one of the notes in the triad
	with the equivalent note in one of its neighbors.
	</p>

	<p>
	To make chord paths more interesting, we randomized the path by
	hiding one neighbor on every pass. The user can enter the same pair 
	of chords and obtain a different path every time.
	</p>

	<h5>Creating chords in WebAudio</h5>

	<p>
	We used WebAudio to implement the lattice&#39s audio aspect. 
	Instead of storing and manipulating note frequencies directly,
	we used MIDI representation. This allowed us to calculate relative
	MIDI note numbers by counting the number of semitones between two notes.
	</p>

	<p>
	We originally wanted to keep track of each chord&#39s inversion to 
	facilitate voice-leading, but this proved to be messy and unnecessary. 
	Instead, we decided to constrain all notes to a single octave, 
	so that the same note name ("A", "F#", etc.) would always be played 
	at the same pitch. This means some chord transitions don&#39t sound 
	as smooth as others if the note names wrap around the octave edges.
	</p>

	<h5>Drawing the lattice in P5</h5>

	<p>
	We used P5.js to programmatically draw the lattice in an HTML canvas. 
	The triangles are rendered one at a time, and 
	the lattice size and position are fully adjustable.
	We used lighter colors to represent inactive triads, and brighter versions
	of the same colons for activated triads.
